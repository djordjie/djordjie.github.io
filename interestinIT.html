            <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
            <p>
                I was always into technology and was fascinated by hackers. My favourite podcast on Spotify was at the time "The Darknet Diaries," where the narrator had interviews with real-life hackers and penetration testers. I enjoyed each episode, and it made me think about my future career. I decided that a good start would be doing certificates in IT.
                I completed a Certificate III in Information, Digital Media, and Technology. After this course, I went to do a Certificate 4 in IT Support, where one of the units was programming in Python. I liked it and soon realised I wanted to learn how to become a programmer and which career to pursue. I decided to withdraw from the Support course and went to do a Certificate IV in Programming instead.
                My determination helped me land my first job in IT as a Technical Support engineer. I still have to decide which direction to go, but I know it will be software development or Artificial Intelligence. Now I am with RMIT! I like to study online as I have a full-time job from Monday to Friday. It helps me to manage my time better without the hassle of commuting.
                I am hoping to learn and understand how technology works. I want to be confident in programming and learn how to work in a team when developing new technology. I believe that this course will help me get my dream job.
