                This position is for a Full Stack Software Engineer.
                This position is appealing because a Full stack developer
                knows both the back end and the front end of software development.
                Developing this type of skill requires years of experience.
                Full-stack software engineers know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                A Full-Stack developer should know NodeJS, React, or AWS, among other frameworks.
                This role is highly paid in Australia, and in most companies, you can work from home or anywhere in Australia.
                I have some experience building a website with HTML and CSS throughout my studies.
                I also worked on a project to build an app with Kotlin in Android Studio.
                As I’m learning, I am more familiar with what skills do Full-Stack developers need to know.
                My plan to be good at these skills is to work on projects and build a portfolio in my future Git Hub profile.
                I believe that that is the best way to learn these skills.
