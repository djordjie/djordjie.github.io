            <h2>My Project Idea</h2>
            <p>
                In researching my project idea, I thought about any real-world problems that I know of and if I could build an app that would help solve this problem.
                These last three years were hectic for all people around the world.
                When Covid hit us on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan, China, as per the information found by the World Health Organisation (World Health Organization, 2020,
                Archived: WHO Timeline – COVID-19, para. 1).
                We soon realised how vulnerable we were. The world’s best scientists worked day and night to find a cure for this frightful disease.
                While people were locked at home watching the news and reading about it on social media. As soon as anything happens globally, it divides people into two different groups.
                On one side, we have people who believe in science, reading scientific publications and documents built by facts.
                On the other side, we have people who don’t think we should trust the government and authorities and like to believe in stories that are not based on facts. My idea of how we could reduce the number of conspiracy theories has a helping us think more rationally.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The app would be a source of information with a database with articles debunking conspiracy theories backed up by relevant research papers and scientific facts. With this app, users would search for any debunked conspiracy theories with the necessary facts, such as articles and documents backed up by research.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                In modern society, there is a lot of misinformation about what is going on.
                It is very easy to see a pattern in anything; even just by looking at clouds, we tend to create visuals that are not there.
                My idea would make it easier for anyone to find the facts.
                There aren’t any statistics in Australia about how many Australians believe in conspiracy theories.
                On the other hand, according to the market leader Statista in “the provision of reliable business data” (Statista 2022), 23% of the population in the US believes that climate change is a hoax.
                As shown in Figure 4, the graph from Statista 2020.
                I think that it would be a helpful app against time-wasting arguments with people who didn’t do enough research about the
                topic they’re so eager to discuss, just by opening this app and using the search tab to find a debunked conspiracy theory,
                just a touch away from the bitter truth. One of the best features would be that users will also be able to contribute.
                Voluntarily completing a survey which could help add more new features to the app. Users will also be able to send suggestions
                to add conspiracy theories that have not been added to the app yet.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                One of the features of this app would be easy access to the most trending and newest conspiracy theories.
                Each conspiracy a user clicks on would direct them to another page with all the necessary documents providing
                the facts and debunking the false belief. There would be one panel on the left side with options such as the
                home tab, Hot/trending, by year, and on the top right corner, there will be a search tab. Also, there would
                be a tab for the users if they would like to contribute to the app or add some new ideas. The app will be designed
                with a simple layout to have a user-friendly format. I believe that by now, there should be some patent or a QR code
                of originality on the internet. Something that would be on every bullet-proofed article for readers to know that what
                they are reading is trustworthy.

            </p>

            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                I would use Android Studio for this app, with Kotlin as the primary programming language. For the database, I would use SQL Lite.
            </p>
