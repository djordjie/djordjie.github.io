                    <h3>The Interview</h3>
                    <p>
                        The interview with Phil was very beneficial for the whole group as most
                        of us have similar goals of becoming developers. As a senior front-end
                        developer, Phill plays a big part in the company. He mainly focuses on
                        developing websites and is highly involved in new projects like the new
                        IGA e-commerce solution. Currently, Phil is working on a new priority
                        shop, one of the government’s solutions in helping people who are not
                        close to big supermarkets like Coles or Woolworths, but they are closer
                        to an IGA. This is where e-commerce comes in. This helps people order
                        essential needs online without having to travel too far. As a front-end
                        developer, Phil works primarily on building websites. This is currently
                        the most challenging part, as Phil described; it’s like making Woolworths
                        from the ground up. Still, he also has another task that includes providing
                        the onboarding team with statistics and dashboards to show retailers what
                        web services they offer and how to integrate the systems that might help
                        them. Phil is very good at what he’s doing. We can see that a big part
                        of his success is the developing part itself and communicating with the
                        whole team from the back end, front end, and the marketing and onboarding
                        team that goes directly on site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We understand now that having the skill
                        and knowing what you are doing is not everything but communicating with
                        the team and sharing your ideas can help others from your team move in
                        the right direction. This is an excellent example of good teamwork, as
                        Phil’s company grew exponentially during covid and expanded and let people
                        work from home anytime they like. This interview has helped us know more
                        about the roles we were pursuing and perhaps also motivated some of us even
                        more. As Phil is very busy with his work, I was able to have this interview
                        with him during his lunch break, which we highly appreciated for such a dynamic
                        IT professional.
