                My personality type, according to the 16Personalities test, is INFP-A. This personality type is called "The Assertive Mediator", as shown in Figure 2. I find this to be very accurate. This personality test has given me some insights into myself.
                My personality type has some positive sides when working in a team. I can adapt and focus on what is essential. I can speak up and work on tasks effectively. My personality connects people as I am very empathic and like to talk to people and make them feel good. I am a good team worker and value other team members' opinions. I like to discuss the bigger picture and can think outside of the box, which can bring some new creative ideas to any project.
