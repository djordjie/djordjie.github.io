                <p>
                    I was born in Sydney, and at the age of 3, my family decided to move to Serbia.
                    Growing up in Serbia, I had a lovely childhood every day; I would play soccer with my friends outside.
                    As life was happening, my family moved back and forth, and eventually, we settled in Slovakia because my mom was Slovakian.
                    I can speak almost four languages, and one fun fact about me is that I had three passports when I was a kid.
                    My hobbies are going to the gym, reading, meditating, but I also like to explore and eat out at different restaurants.
                    I was doing a Bachelor of Science in Business and Administration. However, I dropped out after two years and moved back to Sydney, where I am slowly building my life.
